What I used for key equality:
I used equal?, because I figured that strings might be keys, which would require this.

The second example doesn't correctly call the record the number of times fib is called because the recursive call calls fib, and not mon-fib which increments the counter. So the counter is only incremented on the first call, and not the recursive calls.

; (entry 30 2692537)
; (entry 20 21891)

Did it; fib 8 now only calls fib 9 times.
